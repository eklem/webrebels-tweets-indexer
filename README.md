# Webrebels tweets indexer
An indexer for Webrebels-tweets and the people tweeting

## Tweets
Base it on [life-indexer's twitter indexere](https://github.com/eklem/life-indexer/blob/master/li-twitter-tweets.js), and use both Zapier and IFTTT to gather content. Zapier can extract more accurate info per tweet, but doesn't get the replies, that's where I will still use IFTTT.

## People
Expand the tweets indexer to collect and update a people tweeting & people mentioned JSON. ~~Use this to collect profile URL, profile image, profile name and profile text. Index this.~~ Use Zapier to gather people / user info. Will not work for all tweets, only the ones gatheret with Zapier, but is hopefully a good enough solution.
